> Change in all things is sweet.&#x20;

\-Aristotle\
\
I am retiring from the United States Air Force after 20 years of service. My wife and I have spent our entire adult lives in service to our nation and it's time to say Thank you and goodbye. \
\
The Air Force has given us so much and we are grateful for the time we have spent and the relationships we have built. \
\
The hardest part of it all is we don't know exactly what the future holds. Working in the Air Force is unique in that things change but they are also very constant. You know you have a paycheck. You know where you are going to live (The AF tells you that). You know what your job is going to be (The AF tells you that). \
\
Now I have to grow up and make all these decisions for myself. \
\
I am embracing the challenge and working hard so that Brandy and I can transition to civilian life as seamlessly as possible. I know it won't be easy but luckily I have my best friend and partner with me to enjoy the journey.&#x20;
