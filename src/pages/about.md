I am a full-stack web developer with a passion for creating intuitive, user-friendly websites and applications. With experience in both front-end and back-end technologies, I am skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and postgreSQL.

My ability to bring together the technical and creative aspects of web development allows me to deliver high-quality, functional solutions that meet the needs of both users and clients. I am always eager to learn new technologies and continuously improve my skills, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think critically and find innovative solutions.
